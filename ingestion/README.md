## 3. Dependency Choices

```toml
serde            = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }   # serde round-trips
serde_json       = "1"                                         # JSON value + serialization
thiserror        = "2.0"                                       # typed error enums
tracing          = "0.1"                                       # structured logging
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter", "json"] }
tokio            = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }     # async runtime
axum             = "0.8"                                       # HTTP framework
aws-config       = "1.8.14"                                   # ambient credential chain
aws-sdk-dynamodb = "1"                                        # DynamoDB client
aws-sdk-sqs      = "1.95.0"                                   # SQS client (pinned)
serde_dynamo     = { version = "4", features = ["aws-sdk-dynamodb+1"] }
nanoid           = "0.4"                                       # evt_ ID generation
lambda_http      = "0.13"                                      # Lambda HTTP adapter (Day 4)
```

**Why these specific choices:**

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `thiserror` not `anyhow` | Every failure mode is a named variant. The handler maps each variant to an HTTP status code — `anyhow` would require string matching. |
| `axum` not `actix-web` | Tower-native, composes cleanly with `lambda_http`'s service adapter. `Arc<AppState>` injected via `State` extractor with zero boilerplate. |
| `nanoid` not `uuid` | `evt_` prefix + 16-char nanoid is shorter in URLs/logs than a UUID, but still has >2^80 collision resistance. |
| `serde_dynamo` | Converts between `serde_json`-compatible structs and DynamoDB `AttributeValue` maps — eliminates a wall of `.item("field", AttributeValue::S(…))` boilerplate. |
| `aws-sdk-sqs = "1.95.0"` pinned | Worker crate pins the same version so `Cargo.lock` compiles the SDK once, not twice. |
| `lambda_http = "0.13"` | Bridges API Gateway events into a standard Axum `Service`, with zero changes to handler code. |

---

## 4. Data Models

All types live in `src/model.rs`.

### API boundary types

| Type | HTTP surface | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WebhookReceiveRequest` | `POST /webhooks/receive` body | Inbound event from caller |
| `WebhookReceiveResponse` | 202 / 200 response | Returns `event_id` + status |
| `ReceiveStatus` | enum field | `accepted` \| `duplicate` |
| `CreateConfigRequest` | `POST /webhooks/configs` body | Register a customer endpoint |
| `WebhookConfigResponse` | 201 / 200 response | Config record DTO |

### DynamoDB entity types

| Type | Table | SK pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `WebhookEvent` | `webhook_events` | `v0` (metadata) · `ATTEMPT#n` (delivery records) |
| `WebhookConfig` | `webhook_configs` | `CONFIG` |
| `IdempotencyRecord` | `webhook_idempotency` | _(PK-only table)_ |

### Error enum

```rust
pub enum IngestionError {
    MissingField(String),          // env var absent at cold-start → 500
    ConfigNotFound(String),        // customer has no registered config → 404
    AlreadyExists(String),         // duplicate event write attempted → 409
    Serialization(String),         // JSON/serde failure → 500
    DynamoDb(String),              // AWS SDK DynamoDB error → 500
    Sqs(String),                   // AWS SDK SQS error → 500
    ItemNotFound { entity, key },  // DynamoDB get returned nothing → 404
    DecodeDynamo(String),          // serde_dynamo decode failure → 500
}
```

HTTP status mapping lives in **one place per handler** — `ingestion_error_response()` in `webhook.rs` and `config_error_response()` in `config.rs`. Nothing in the service layer makes HTTP decisions.

---

## 5. DynamoDB Key Contracts

Enforced by `pk()` / `sk()` helpers on each struct and locked by unit tests.
Changing these is a **breaking change** for both engineers.

| Table | PK | SK | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `webhook_events` | `EVENT#{event_id}` | `v0` | `EVENT#evt_1a2b3c / v0` |
| `webhook_events` | `EVENT#{event_id}` | `ATTEMPT#{n}` | `EVENT#evt_1a2b3c / ATTEMPT#1` |
| `webhook_configs` | `CUSTOMER#{customer_id}` | `CONFIG` | `CUSTOMER#cust_xyz / CONFIG` |
| `webhook_idempotency` | `IDEM#{idempotency_key}` | _(PK-only)_ | `IDEM#req_abc123` |

---

## 6. Cross-Team Wire Format

`WebhookEvent` (ingestion) and `Event` (worker) must serialize to **identical JSON**.
Verified by the cross-team fixture test on both sides:

```json
{
  "event_id":      "evt_1a2b3c4d",
  "customer_id":   "cust_xyz123",
  "payload":       "{\"order_id\":\"ord_123\",\"amount\":99.99}",
  "status":        "pending",
  "attempt_count": 0,
  "created_at":    1707840000,
  "delivered_at":  null,
  "next_retry_at": null
}
```

`EventStatus` is `snake_case` in both crates. Any rename here is a silent data
corruption — the worker would fail to deserialize existing DynamoDB records.

**SQS message contract** (ingestion writes, worker reads):

```json
{ "event_id": "evt_1a2b3c4d" }
```

`customer_id` travels as a `MessageAttribute` (DataType: `String`), not in the
body. This lets the worker read the routing key without deserializing JSON.

---

## 7. Day 3 — SQS Integration & Webhook Handler

### What was built

**`services/queue.rs` — SQS enqueue**

```rust
pub async fn enqueue_event(
    client: &SqsClient,
    queue_url: &str,
    event_id: &str,
    customer_id: &str,
) -> Result<(), IngestionError>
```

Key design: `customer_id` is a `MessageAttribute`, not in the JSON body. The
worker needs it to look up `webhook_configs` — putting it in the attribute means
zero extra DynamoDB reads on the delivery hot path.

**`handlers/webhook.rs` — the 5-step pipeline**

```
1. req.validate()                  → 422 on empty key, bad chars, payload > 400KB
2. idempotency::check_and_record() → 200 if duplicate (no further writes)
3. events::create_event()          → DynamoDB PutItem, 30d TTL
4. queue::enqueue_event()          → SQS SendMessage + customer_id attribute
5. return 202 Accepted             → { event_id, status: "accepted", created_at }
```

`AppState` wraps both AWS clients + `AppConfig` in an `Arc<AppState>` injected
via Axum's `State` extractor — no global state, no `lazy_static`, fully testable.

### Thinking behind the idempotency design

The naive approach is **read-then-write**: check if the key exists, then write if
not. This has a TOCTOU race — two concurrent requests with the same key both read
"not found" before either writes. Instead we use a **conditional PutItem**
(`attribute_not_exists(pk)`). This is atomic at the DynamoDB level — only one
succeeds; the other gets `ConditionalCheckFailedException`. No locking, no
transactions, no second round-trip.

### Thinking behind 202 vs 200

202 Accepted = "I received your request and will act on it." The event is in SQS
— not yet delivered. Returning 200 OK would imply the work is done. Callers who
need to track delivery status use the returned `event_id` to poll (future Day 5
endpoint). The semantic distinction protects callers from assuming delivered =
accepted.

---

## 8. Day 4 — Config Management & Lambda Entry Point

### What was built

**`services/configs.rs` — DynamoDB CRUD**

```rust
pub async fn put_config(client, table, config) -> Result<(), IngestionError>
pub async fn fetch_config(client, table, customer_id) -> Result<WebhookConfig, IngestionError>
```

`put_config` is an unconditional `PutItem` (upsert). This is intentional — callers
can rotate their signing secret or update their delivery URL by POSTing again.
The PK/SK are injected into the serialized `AttributeValue` map manually, since
`serde_dynamo` serializes struct fields but not the DynamoDB key attributes which
aren't on the struct.

**`handlers/config.rs` — config handlers**

`POST /webhooks/configs`: Accepts `{ customer_id, url, secret? }`. If `secret` is
omitted or empty, generates `whsec_{32 alphanumeric chars}` using `nanoid` with a
custom alphabet. Returns 201 with the full config record.

`GET /webhooks/configs?customer_id=…`: Returns 200 with the config, or 404 if
none registered.

**`src/main.rs` — Lambda entry point**

Cold-start sequence:

```
1. tracing_subscriber::fmt().json()  → structured JSON logs for CloudWatch
2. AppConfig::from_env()             → fail fast if any env var is missing
3. aws_config::load_defaults()       → load execution role credentials
4. build_dynamo_client() + SqsClient → reused across all warm invocations
5. Arc::new(AppState { dynamo, sqs, config })
6. Router::new()
     .route("/webhooks/receive",   post(receive_webhook))
     .route("/webhooks/configs",   post(create_config))
     .route("/webhooks/configs",   get(get_config))
     .with_state(state)
7. lambda_http::run(app)             → blocks; wakes per API Gateway invocation
```

**Why `lambda_http` not raw `lambda_runtime`?** `lambda_http` handles the
API Gateway → HTTP request translation automatically. Handlers are written as
pure Axum handlers — they never see the Lambda event envelope. No code change
is needed to move from API Gateway REST to HTTP API or even to a local dev server.

### Thinking behind secret generation

Secrets use `nanoid` with a custom 62-character alphabet (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) — no
ambiguous symbols (`+`, `/`, `=`) that could cause encoding bugs when the worker
interpolates the secret into an HMAC computation. The `whsec_` prefix makes
secrets distinguishable in logs from other credential types (API keys, tokens).

The caller can supply their own secret (useful for migrating an existing customer
from another platform). An empty string is treated as "generate one" — not as a
valid empty secret — because an empty HMAC key would accept any payload.

---

## 9. Day 5 — Integration Testing & Engineer 2 Handoff

### What was built

**`ingestion/tests/integration_test.sh`** — a bash script that drives the live
API Gateway + Lambda and verifies every contract item agreed with Engineer 2
(`CONTRACT_CONFIRMATION_LIST.md §10`). Runs `set -euo pipefail`, coloured
pass/fail output, and cleans up all created DynamoDB rows + SQS messages on
`EXIT` regardless of failures.

**`docs/handoff-engineer2.md`** — the full handoff document for Engineer 2
covering SQS contract, DynamoDB schemas, state-transition responsibilities,
HMAC algorithm, retryable vs terminal HTTP codes, duplicate-message handling
spec, sample AWS CLI queries, and change-control rules.

### Integration test walkthrough

The script runs 10 test cases in order. Each one builds on the previous:

```
Test 1  POST /webhooks/configs          → 201, whsec_ prefix on auto-generated secret
Test 2  POST /webhooks/receive          → 202, evt_ prefix on event_id, valid timestamp
Test 3  POST /webhooks/receive (replay) → 200, same event_id returned (idempotency)
Test 4  POST /webhooks/receive          → not 202/200 for unknown customer (no config)
Test 5  POST /webhooks/receive          → 422/400 for missing idempotency_key (validation)
Test 6  GET  /webhooks/configs          → 200, all fields round-trip, secret matches create
Test 7  GET  /webhooks/configs          → 404 for unknown customer
Test 8  DynamoDB — event row            → pk/sk contract, all required fields, status=pending, attempt_count=0
Test 9  DynamoDB — idempotency record   → event_id correct, TTL ≈ 24h from now
Test 10 SQS — message in queue          → body = {"event_id":"..."} only, customer_id as MessageAttribute
```

To run it against a deployed stack:

```bash
export API_BASE_URL="https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
export EVENTS_TABLE="webhook_events_dev"
export IDEMPOTENCY_TABLE="webhook_idempotency_dev"
export CONFIGS_TABLE="webhook_configs_dev"
export QUEUE_URL="https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/520819257503/webhook_delivery_dev"
bash ingestion/tests/integration_test.sh
```

Pass `KEEP_TEST_DATA=true` to skip cleanup for manual DynamoDB / SQS inspection.

### Thinking behind the test design

**Why bash, not a Rust integration test?**  
The integration tests cross a network boundary — API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB
+ SQS. A Rust test binary would need to be compiled and injected into the Lambda
runtime or run with live AWS credentials baked in. A bash script with `curl` and
`aws` CLI is self-contained, zero compile time, runnable by either engineer with
no Rust toolchain, and trivially modifiable without a full `cargo build` cycle.

**Why test in this order?**  
Config must exist before a webhook can be received (the handler validates it).
The idempotency test must reuse the same `idempotency_key` as the happy-path test
to prove the same record is returned. DynamoDB / SQS verification tests run last
because the event must be fully written before they query.

**Why poll SQS instead of directly asserting?**  
SQS is eventually consistent for `ReceiveMessage` — the message is usually
visible within a second, but the API spec does not guarantee it. The script polls
with a configurable timeout (default 30s) and interval (default 2s) to avoid
flaky failures under transient queue delays.

**Why assert `body_keys == 1`?**  
Contract §6 says the SQS message body is **exactly** `{"event_id":"..."}` — one
key only. An accidental `payload` or `customer_id` leak into the body would
silently bloat every SQS message and break the worker's deserialization contract.
The key-count assertion catches that regression at test time.

### Git workflow on Day 5

Day 5 introduced the fork + upstream remote pattern:

```
upstream → HooRay-IO/HooRay-Relay   (org repo — submit PRs here)
origin   → Raydiate09/HooRay-Relay  (personal fork — push branches here)
```

Commands used:
```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/Raydiate09/HooRay-Relay.git
git push origin main                                        # seed fork's main
git push origin feat/engineer1-day5-integration-handoff    # push feature branch
# Open PR on GitHub: base = HooRay-IO/HooRay-Relay:main
```

Keeping in sync going forward:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main && git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### Questions encountered on Day 5

**Q: Why does the integration test script not verify the worker delivered the
webhook? Isn't that the whole point?**

A: The ingestion integration test only covers **ingestion contracts** — what
Engineer 1 owns. Verifying worker delivery is Engineer 2's job in their own
integration test (`worker/tests/end_to_end_test.sh`). Testing across ownership
boundaries in a single script would make the test brittle: a worker bug would
cause an ingestion test to fail, misleading the on-call engineer. Clear ownership
= clear failure attribution.

**Q: The SQS message stays in the queue after the test — won't the worker Lambda
pick it up and try to deliver to a fake URL?**

A: The cleanup function deletes the SQS message via its `ReceiptHandle` after the
test passes. If the test fails before reaching test 10, the message was never
received (no receipt handle), so it stays in the queue until the visibility
timeout expires. Since `DELIVERY_URL` points at `webhook.site` (a safe sink),
any accidental delivery attempt is harmless. For CI environments, set
`QUEUE_URL` to a separate test queue with a DLQ and no worker Lambda subscribed.

**Q: Why use a fork (`Raydiate09/HooRay-Relay`) instead of pushing branches
directly to the org repo (`HooRay-IO/HooRay-Relay`)?**

A: The org repo is shared by both engineers. Pushing feature branches directly
to it works but pollutes the branch list. More importantly, the fork model
enforces that every change to `main` goes through a PR review by the other
engineer — you can't accidentally `git push upstream main`. The fork is a
guardrail, not just a convention.

**Q: Should `KEEP_TEST_DATA` default to `true` during active development?**

A: No. Leaving test data accumulates cost (DynamoDB storage, SQS message
retention) and can cause false positives in subsequent test runs if a row
from a previous run happens to match the generated `customer_id`. Always default
to cleanup. Use `KEEP_TEST_DATA=true` only when you need to inspect a failure.

## 10. Bugs Encountered & Solutions

### Bug 1 — Duplicate `mod tests` block in `worker/src/model.rs` (Day 1)

**Symptom:** `cargo test -p ingestion` failed to compile with:
```
error[E0428]: the name `tests` is defined multiple times
```

**Root cause:** `worker/src/model.rs` had two `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { … }`
blocks — one after the `Event` impl, one at the end of the file. Rust disallows
a module name being defined twice in the same namespace.

**Fix:** Merged into a single `mod tests` block at the bottom. Restored the
accidentally overwritten test name `event_serialization_round_trip`.

**Lesson:** Keep exactly **one** `mod tests` block per file, at the bottom.
`cargo test` catches this immediately; run it before every commit.

---

### Bug 2 — AWS SQS SDK builder accepts missing `string_value` silently (Day 3)

**Symptom:** A test named `customer_id_attribute_rejects_missing_string_value`
failed — the SDK builder did **not** error when `string_value` was omitted.

**Root cause:** Wrong assumption about the SDK. `MessageAttributeValue::builder()`
with only `.data_type("String")` builds successfully. Calling `.string_value()`
on the result returns `None` — it is not validated at build time.

**Fix:** Renamed the test to `customer_id_attribute_string_value_is_none_when_omitted`
and documented the actual SDK behavior. The production code still always provides
`string_value` — only the test expectation was wrong.

**Lesson:** Don't assume SDK builders validate their inputs. Write a test that
documents the actual behavior, not the assumed behavior.

---

### Bug 3 — Copilot review introduced a call to a non-existent function (Day 3 PR)

**Symptom:** CI failed with:
```
error[E0425]: cannot find function `get_existing_event_created_at` in module `idempotency`
help: a function with a similar name exists: `get_existing_event_id`
```

**Root cause:** A Copilot code review suggestion rewrote the duplicate-path
handler to fetch the original `created_at` via `idempotency::get_existing_event_created_at()`
— a function it invented that was never written. The actual function is
`get_existing_event_id()` and returns only the `event_id` string.

**Fix:** Removed the entire invented 23-line block. The duplicate response
uses `unix_now_secs()` for `created_at`, which is the correct semantic —
"when this duplicate request was received", not the original event's timestamp.
Returning the original timestamp would require fetching the full `IdempotencyRecord`,
which is a separate scoped change.

**Lesson:** Always run `cargo build` after accepting AI review suggestions before
merging. AI code review can introduce plausible-looking but non-existent function
names. Never auto-merge without a passing CI build.

---

### Bug 4 — `Cargo.lock` not committed after adding `lambda_http` (Day 4)

**Symptom:** CI `cargo clippy --locked` failed with:
```
error: cannot update the lock file because --locked was passed
```

**Root cause:** `lambda_http = "0.13"` was added to `Cargo.toml` and compiled
locally (which updates `Cargo.lock`), but `Cargo.lock` was not staged in the
commit. CI's `--locked` flag requires the lockfile to exactly match `Cargo.toml`.

**Fix:** `git add Cargo.lock && git commit -m "chore: update Cargo.lock"`.

**Lesson:** Any `Cargo.toml` dependency change must be paired with a `Cargo.lock`
commit. A simple pre-push rule: `cargo build` → `git status` → if `Cargo.lock`
appears, stage it.

---

### Bug 5 — `rustfmt` import ordering and line-length violations (Day 3 CI)

**Symptom:** `cargo fmt --all -- --check` exited 1 in CI with diffs across
`webhook.rs` and `queue.rs`.

**Root cause:** `rustfmt` sorts `use` statements by full module path
alphabetically — `use crate::services::dynamodb::AppConfig` must come before
`use crate::services::{events, idempotency, queue}` because `d` < `{`. Also,
`assert_eq!` calls with three arguments and struct constructors exceeded the
100-character line limit and needed to be expanded.

**Fix:** `cargo fmt --all` (auto-applies all corrections), then verified
`--check` exits 0, then committed the formatted files.

**Lesson:** Run `cargo fmt --all` locally before every push — never hand-format
imports. Add `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to CI so formatting is enforced on
every PR.

CI checks (must all pass before merge):

```bash
cargo test --workspace                                                       # 79 total (incl. worker)
cargo fmt --all -- --check                                                   # 0 diffs
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings

## 12. Roadmap — Week 2

### Week 2

| Day | Topic | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | CloudWatch dashboards | Webhook receive rate, idempotency hit %, error rates, p95 latency |
| 7 | API documentation | OpenAPI spec, customer onboarding guide, Postman collection |
| 8 | CI/CD pipeline | GitHub Actions: test → fmt → clippy → `sam deploy` to staging on merge |
| 9 | Load testing | k6 at 500 req/sec, < 100ms p95, < 0.1% error rate |
| 10 | Final polish | README, demo script, tag v1.0.0 |

### Known technical debt

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `WebhookEvent` TTL field missing from DynamoDB serialization | High | `ttl` attribute needs to be injected at write time (same pattern as configs PK/SK) |
| Config validation (URL format, secret length) | Medium | `CreateConfigRequest` has no `validate()` method yet |
| `GET /webhooks/configs` authentication | Medium | Currently anyone can read any customer's config by guessing `customer_id` |
| `duplicate` response `created_at` returns "now" not original timestamp | Low | Would require fetching full `IdempotencyRecord`; scoped for Week 2 |
| Integration tests run against live stack only | Medium | No local DynamoDB Local / LocalStack setup yet |
